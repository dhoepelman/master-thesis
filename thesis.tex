\section{Comparing spreadsheets to other programming paradigms}

\subsection{Reactive programming}
As explained in chapter \ref{chapter:anatomy}, the spreadsheet programming model is a variation of the dataflow programming model.
Thus the most natural first comparison for spreadsheet is the \emph{reactive programming} paradigm, which is another variation of the dataflow programming model.
Viewed from the RP model, all spreadsheet cells are observable values and every formula is an observer.
One can attach a formula observer to a cell observable by making a reference, e.g. a formula \f{=A1+1} in cell B1 listens to the value of A1 and produces the value for B1.
However for the purpose of finding refactorings this is not an useful comparison, as no literature on refactoring reactive programs is known to the author.

\subsection{Functional programming}
Spreadsheets program do not contain state (mutable variables) or side-effects
\footnote{As long as one remains within the spreadsheet model. User-defined functions and inter-operation with external programs can cause side-effects.}
and this immutability aspect is often associated with functional programming languages.
However spreadsheets lack several other important concepts of functional languages such as first-class and higher-order functions, recursion\footnote{Most spreadsheet implementations allow for a form of recursion in the form of cycles in the dependency graph called circular references. However this is not the normal modus-operandi, triggers a warning and is generally only used to perform iterative calculations which are not otherwise possible in spreadsheets.}, lazy evaluation and type interference.

Some literature exist on refactoring functional programs, most prominent is the tool \textbf{Ha}skell \textbf{Re}factoring tool (HaRe) \cite{thompson2005refactoring}.
Most of the described refactorings are either specific to Haskell, or only applicable because of concepts not available in spreadsheets.

This makes all of the current literature on refactoring functional programs not applicable.
