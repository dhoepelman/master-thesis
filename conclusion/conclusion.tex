While extending the BumbleBee spreadsheet refactoring tool it was found that the existing spreadsheet formula parser was insufficient to support refactoring without the risk of introducing errors.
To solve this problem, the existing parser was improved, named XLParser and publicly released as open-source with a binary\footnote{\url{https://github.com/spreadsheetlab/XLParser/releases}}, online demo\footnote{\url{http://xlparser.perfectxl.nl/demo}}, source code\footnote{\url{https://github.com/spreadsheetlab/XLParser}} and EBNF grammar available.
The parser is geared towards spreadsheet research and therefore is highly compatible with the official language and produces parse trees which are suitable for further analysis and manipulation.
The parser was evaluated on over a million formulas from two datasets and parsed 99.999\%.
Bumblebee was extended with six refactorings: \rf{Extract Formula}, \rf{Inline Formula}, \rf{Introduce Cell Name}, \rf{Group References}, \rf{Introduce Aggregate} and \rf{Introduce Conditional Aggregate}.
\rf{Inline formula}, \rf{Group References} and \rf{Introduce Conditional Aggregate} were not implemented before and \rf{Extract Formula} and \rf{Introduce Cell Name} improve upon previous implementations.
