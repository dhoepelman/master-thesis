# Intro

Now luckily Computer Scientists have totally figured out how to build perfect programs, so we can just use principles from computer science to solve this problem.

# Parsing

In elementary school, you've learned how to diagram a sentence.

# Formula transformation

Regex like, kan geen omringende cellen meenemen.

Exploration van generieke "transformatie taal", maar slap aftreksel van VBA/Python Excel-addin. Generieke taal met library voor Excel.

## Improvements

You can add all sorts of cool functionality to the formula language, but at some point you stop being a spreadsheet and become Haskell with built-in table storage and display mechanism.

"Or as I would like to call it: Haskell with a built-in table storage and display mechanism"

Apart from some cruft that's in the language I think that the main improvements should be a better formula editor, user defined functions in the spreadsheet itself and first-class matrices.

Formula editor is something Microsoft are aware of themselves. Not high enough priority probably.
