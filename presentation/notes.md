## Improvements

You can add all sorts of cool functionality to the formula language, but at some point you stop being a spreadsheet and become Haskell with built-in table storage and display mechanism.

Apart from some cruft that's in the language I think that the main improvements should be a better formula editor, user defined functions in the spreadsheet itself and first-class matrices.
